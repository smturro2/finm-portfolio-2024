In a long-only portfolio, lower correlation with other assets, higher expected return, and lower volatility (the last two are directly related to Sharpe) are the main estimates responsible for defining (and more specifically increasing) weights in optimal MV portfolios. In summary, by lowering TIPS correlation with SPY and IEF we can ensure bigger absolute value of Sharpe in the tangency portfolio.\n",
